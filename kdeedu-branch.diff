-Packaging kdeedu for Debian
----------------------------
-
-Note that kstars ships with a number of images that are not DFSG-free.
-These images need to be removed from the original upstream tarball
-before debian packaging takes place.  To do this, unpack the original
-upstream tarball into kdeedu-<version>.orig as usual, and then run
-
-  debian/clean-sources
-
-from the top-level kdeedu-<version>.orig directory.  The same must also
-be done from the working kdeedu-<version> directory where the usual
-debian-specific changes are to be made.

+.SH NAME
+fliccd \- Finger Lakes Instruments CCD driver for INDI telescope control
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B v4ldriver
+[ \fB\-v\fP ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+KStars allows you to configure
+and control astronomical instruments such as telescopes and focusers via
+the INDI protocol.  \fBfliccd\fP is a device driver for supporting
+particular types of external hardware.
+.PP
+You should normally not need to run this driver directly.  Instead you
+should use KStars to configure and operate your astronomical instruments.
+Most operations can be found under the Device menu within KStars.
+.PP
+KStars will start the INDI server internally, and the INDI server will
+in turn start this device driver.
+.PP
+Much more detailed information can be found in the KStars Handbook, as
+described below.
+.PP
+KStars is a graphical desktop planetarium for KDE, and forms part of
+the official KDE edutainment module.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fP
+Write more verbose output to stderr.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.BR indiserver (1),
+.BR kstars (1).
+.PP
+The KStars Handbook contains detailed information on how to use INDI for
+telescope control.  You can read this handbook in the KDE Help Centre.
+Alternatively you can enter the URL
+\fIhelp:/kstars/indi.html\fP
+directly into konqueror or you can run
+`\fIkhelpcenter help:/kstars/indi.html\fP'
+from the command-line.
+.PP
+If the KDE Help Centre is not installed then you can install the package
+\fIkdeedu-doc-html\fP and read this documentation in HTML format from
+\fI/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/kstars/indi.html\fP.

+.SH NAME
+klatin \- an application to help revise/teach Latin
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B klatin
+.RI "[ " generic-options " ]"
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBKLatin\fP is a program to help revise Latin.  There are three "sections"
+in which different aspects of the language can be revised.  These are the
+vocabulary, grammar and verb testing sections.  In addition there is a
+set of revision notes that can be used for self-guided revision.
+.PP
+In the vocabulary section an XML file is loaded containing various
+words and their local language translations.  KLatin asks you what each
+of these words translate into.  The questions take place in a
+multiple-choice environment.
+.PP
+In the grammar and verb sections KLatin asks for a particular part of a
+noun or a verb, such as the "ablative singular", or the "1st person
+indicative passive plural", and is not multiple choice.
+.PP
+This application is part of the official KDE edutainment module.
+.SH OPTIONS
+For a full summary of options, run \fIklatin \-\-help\fP.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+Full user documentation is available through the KDE Help Centre.
+You can also enter the URL
+\fIhelp:/klatin/\fP
+directly into konqueror or you can run
+`\fIkhelpcenter help:/klatin/\fP'
+from the command-line.
+.PP
+If the KDE Help Centre is not installed then you can install the package
+\fIkdeedu-doc-html\fP and read this documentation in HTML format from
+\fI/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/klatin/\fP.
+.SH AUTHOR

+.SH NAME
+kturtle \- an educational Logo programming environment
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B kturtle
+.RI "[ " generic-options " ]"
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBKTurtle\fP is an educational programming environment using the Logo
+programming language.  It tries to make programming as easy and
+accessible as possible.  This makes KTurtle suitable for teaching kids
+the basics of mathematics, geometry and programming.
+.PP
+The commands used to program are in the style of the Logo programming
+language.  The unique feature of Logo is that the commands are often
+translated into the speaking language of the programmer.
+.PP
+KTurtle is named after "the turtle" that plays a central role in the
+programming environment.  The user programs the turtle, using the Logo
+commands, to draw a picture on the canvas.
+.PP
+Note that this version of Logo is only focused on the educational
+qualities of the programming language and will not try to suit
+professional programmers' needs.
+.PP
+This application is part of the official KDE edutainment module.
+.SH OPTIONS
+For a full summary of options, run \fIkturtle \-\-help\fP.
+.SH SEE ALSO

+You can also enter the URL
+\fIhelp:/kturtle/\fP
+directly into konqueror or you can run
+`\fIkhelpcenter help:/kturtle/\fP'

+.PP

+.SH NAME
+test_extdate \- text-based tests for the ExtDate classes
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B test_extdate
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This is a simple test program for testing the non-GUI functionality of the
+ExtDate classes.  It compares the results of several operations against
+the results from QDate and writes the results to the console.
+.PP
+The \fBExtDate library\fP consists of a group of classes allowing KDE
+applications to access calendar dates outside of the limited range of
+years imposed by QDate.
+.PP
+The QDate class has a limited range of valid dates.  It does not
+recognize dates prior to 14 Oct 1752 (when the Gregorian calendar
+was adopted by England), nor dates after 31 Dec 8000.  Both of these
+limits are arbitrary.
+.PP
+This library is part of the official KDE edutainment module.

+test_extdatepicker \- GUI-based tests for the ExtDate classes
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B test_extdatepicker
+[ \fIgeneric-options\fP ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This is a simple test program for testing the graphical functionality of
+the ExtDate classes.  It presents a KDatePicker widget and an
+ExtDatePicker widget side by side for user interaction.
+.PP
+The \fBExtDate library\fP consists of a group of classes allowing KDE
+applications to access calendar dates outside of the limited range of
+years imposed by QDate.
+.PP
+The QDate class has a limited range of valid dates.  It does not
+recognize dates prior to 14 Oct 1752 (when the Gregorian calendar
+was adopted by England), nor dates after 31 Dec 8000.  Both of these
+limits are arbitrary.
+.PP
+This library is part of the official KDE edutainment module.
+.SH OPTIONS
+For a full summary of options, run \fItest_extdatepicker \-\-help\fP.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.BR test_extdate (1).
+.PP
+See \fI/usr/share/doc/libkdeedu-dev/README.extdate\fP for further
+information on this library.

+v4ldriver \- Video4Linux Generic driver for INDI telescope control
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B v4ldriver
+[ \fB\-v\fP ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+KStars allows you to configure
+and control astronomical instruments such as telescopes and focusers via
+the INDI protocol.  \fBv4ldriver\fP is a device driver for supporting
+particular types of external hardware.
+.PP
+You should normally not need to run this driver directly.  Instead you
+should use KStars to configure and operate your astronomical instruments.
+Most operations can be found under the Device menu within KStars.
+.PP
+KStars will start the INDI server internally, and the INDI server will
+in turn start this device driver.
+.PP
+Much more detailed information can be found in the KStars Handbook, as
+described below.
+.PP
+KStars is a graphical desktop planetarium for KDE, and forms part of
+the official KDE edutainment module.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fP
+Write more verbose output to stderr.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.BR indiserver (1),
+.BR kstars (1).
+.PP
+The KStars Handbook contains detailed information on how to use INDI for
+telescope control.  You can read this handbook in the KDE Help Centre.
+Alternatively you can enter the URL
+\fIhelp:/kstars/indi.html\fP
+directly into konqueror or you can run
+`\fIkhelpcenter help:/kstars/indi.html\fP'
+from the command-line.
+.PP
+If the KDE Help Centre is not installed then you can install the package
+\fIkdeedu-doc-html\fP and read this documentation in HTML format from
